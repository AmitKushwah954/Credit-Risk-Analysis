💳 I built a Credit Risk & Credit Scoring Model using Logistic Regression 🤖 to predict the Probability of Default (PD) 📉 and classify customers into risk categories (Good ✅ vs. Bad ❌ Credit).

📊 Additionally, I applied Regression techniques to estimate key financial parameters such as Loss Given Default (LGD) 💰 and Exposure at Default (EAD) 📈.

🛠️ The project included:

Feature Engineering ⚙️ (payment history, financial ratios, demographics)

Weight of Evidence (WoE) Transformation 📑

Handling Class Imbalance ⚖️

Model Validation ✅ using ROC-AUC, KS-Statistic, and Confusion Matrix

🏦 The final output was a Credit Scorecard 🏅 that translated predicted PD into actionable Credit Scores, enabling smarter lending decisions.
